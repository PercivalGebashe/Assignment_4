# Spring Boot Database Querying & Filtering

## Overview
This project is a Spring Boot application designed to provide RESTful API endpoints for querying and filtering data from a relational database. Leveraging Spring Data JPA and modern Spring Boot practices, the application offers flexible and efficient data retrieval capabilities while ensuring a modular and scalable codebase.

## Features
- **RESTful API Endpoints:** Easily query and filter data through well-defined endpoints.
- **Spring Data JPA Integration:** Simplified database operations with Spring Data JPA.
- **Flexible Filtering:** Apply dynamic filtering on various fields to meet diverse query requirements.
- **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns across controllers, services, and repositories.
- **Configurable Database Connectivity:** Easily modify database settings via `application.properties`.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java:** JDK 8 or later
- **Maven:** Latest version
- A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) configured and accessible

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PercivalGebashe/Assignment_4.git
   cd Assignment_4
   ```
2. **Configure the database:**
   - Open `src/main/resources/application.properties`
   - Update the database connection properties (URL, username, password) as needed.
3. **Build the project:**
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Running the Application
To start the Spring Boot application, run:
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Alternatively, you can run the packaged JAR:
```sh
java -jar target/<your-jar-file>.jar
```

## API Usage
Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/api/your-endpoint`) to query and filter data. Refer to the API documentation (if available) or inspect the controller classes for endpoint details.
